        <h1>Welcome to Food R & D</h1>
        
        <p>Food R & D is inspired by the <a href='http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/post-2015-consensus/food-security-and-nutrition'> Copenhagen Consensus Report on Food Security</a></p>
        <p>Find reviews of current food issues and my research projects on the subject.</p>
        
        <h2>Topics of research</h2>
        <p>There are four main cereal crops; wheat, maize, rice, and soybeans, and these cerals supply 64% percent of the world's calories<sup><a href='http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v3/n12/full/ncomms2296.html'>1</a></sup>. Each year the yields of the four majors crops increase, but major declines have been observed in some regions. For instance maize yeild has collapsed in several southern African countries. The authors list several reasons why yields have stagnated such as; heat stress, loss of soil nutrients, increased salt in soils, water scarcity, pest species and disease. Two crops are requested cold tolerant wheat and rice able to grow in nutrient poor soil.</p>
